"And then I had an idea... a rather radical one. What if we split the cases completely? 
Most of what we type is lower case, so why not put all those on the home row?....

In truth, the secret of the space/H/h key is this: H is not "shift-space". 
H has nothing to do with Space. This concept can be extended...

The plan was rapidly taking shape.... a three-row setup, with Caps on top row, 
lower case on home row, and digits and punctuation on bottom row.

Since we have 10x3 slots on each row (or 11x3), and only 26 letters, 
we could put the most used puncutation on home row as well, 
and another four on top row. "

Note that I cannot use my txt2autokey to handle the whole kbd since
it uses 6 keys, bottom right row (need to map RShift on Us Kbd)
and it maps a home key to Space.
So will need a bit of manul work ;-)
...
or move that key to 1st row !!
solution for now

so:
(will use @ as placeholder for Space)
