X7.2H-en on SmartYao LY092-SN

This version uses as base a qwerty setup on the SmartYao LY092-SN (Koolertron)
(right hand is 'qwertyShifted' so that the home row is where we want it)
with X7.2H-en specific mods for the alt/shift etc keys

**Note: the LY092-SN des NOT output Alt_R, so we use Numpad5 as altGr instead !

the defined LY092-SN base :
