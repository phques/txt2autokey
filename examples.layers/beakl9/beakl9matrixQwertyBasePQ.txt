BEAKL9 on SmartYao LY092-SN

This version uses as base a qwerty setup on the SmartYao LY092-SN (Koolertron)
(right hand is 'qwertyShifted' so that the home row is where we want it)
with BEAKL9 specific mods for the alt/shift etc keys

**Note: the LY092-SN des NOT output Alt_R, so we use Numpad5 as altGr instead !

the defined LY092-SN base is the same as beakl10:
see https://github.com/phques/SmartYaoLayout.git
in  profile\BEAKL10\qwertyBased

The modifications to the hardware qwerty base layouts are:

--Left--
CapsLock => -

Thumbs (<> than orig BEAKL10):
  enter, space control, backspace

moved from beakl10 (because of chgs to thumbs)
  left, right, up, down

--right--
thumbs
  tab, Shift_R, Num5 (as AltGr), Alt_R
  
moved from beakl10 (because of chgs to thumbs)
  PgUp, PgDn, Home,End
