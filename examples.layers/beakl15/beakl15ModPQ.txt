notes:
+ D on altGr on T is not very good after all ;-p (good scores in KLA!)
 -> maybe try it on altGr space (a la x1-h) ?
 -> or   g  instead of  d
       d w            g w
   => worst results in KLA !!
   same thing if I bring D back to its original place on main
   
 => seems like D on S works ok w. KLA .. have to try myself to see !!
pq

remove digits!! more space, frees up good spots
can even move tough chars from main mid columns here ?

changed a bunch of syms, bring down from top row etc
 and tough syms from altgr &
 
also swap /, on main (tested on KLA : better scores)

had to place these:
_+-*& ! [%]
gwd x.@'` ;

w. US wide mode : use altGr Enter for ';' ?? (not avail on main, right hand shifted)
placed on capsLock at 1st, but left is getting pretty heavy !

changed altGr inteferes w. numpad: xX => 9
(which I dont usually use)
